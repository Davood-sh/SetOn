# SetOn
SetOn is an event platform that aims at minimizing the time that a user needs to search for an event. 
It was born from the difficulties that users experience while gathering information about events. 
Mainly,
1. fragmentation: too many platforms to compare. Personalization from one platform does not 
carry to the others.
2. fear of missing out: many users in the past missed an event that they would have liked to 
attend. This is caused by the focus that other platforms put on long term planning, while short 
term planning allows users to be more aware of events that surround them.

The goal of our project is to bring people together to explore real-life events and join meaningful 
communities
